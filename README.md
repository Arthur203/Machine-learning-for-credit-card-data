RecallOptimizer
This repository contains a Machine Learning project that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to explore different configurations of a model with the goal of maximizing recall metric. The main code performs the following tasks:

Model Training: Uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to train the model on training data.
Test Data Prediction: Uses the trained model to make predictions on test data.
Recall Calculation: Calculates the recall metric for the model’s predictions on test data. Recall is calculated considering ‘good’ as the positive class.
Analysis of Different Model Configurations: Calculates recall for different model configurations on test data.
Results Visualization: Creates a line graph to visualize the model’s recall for different configurations. The graph includes a legend for easy interpretation.
The project uses a specific dataset for training and testing the model. This dataset contains various features that are used to predict the target class. The target class is binary, with ‘good’ indicating a positive outcome.

This project is useful for understanding how different configurations of a model can affect the recall metric. It can be adapted to work with different models and metrics, making it a valuable tool for optimizing Machine Learning models.

Note: For a more detailed description of the dataset, you will need to provide more information about the dataset’s features, such as the number of features, number of observations, nature of features (e.g., categorical, numerical), etc.
